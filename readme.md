# jQuery Countdown

jQuery Countdown is a plugin that allows you to easily create as many countdowns on your website as you would like. You can setup a countdown schedule by passing it in options or you can specify a data-countdown attribute to the div your calling jQuery Countdown on.

## Installation

Drop jquery.countdown.js into your scripts folder. Drop jquery.countdown.css into your styles folder if you wish. Really you should just create your own styles. I've included jquery.countdown.css for reference.

## Usage

Simple: Use the countdown() method on a div with a data-countdown attribute.

````
<div id="countdown" data-countdown="January 1, 2020 15:00:00"></div>
